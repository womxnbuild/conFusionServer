## ConFusionServer
 Yay, we have hit Week 2 of the Coursera program! 

Extension of a simple express application using `express-generator` for scaffolding.

### Instructions:

- Checkout to the code, and open the project on a preferred idea
- Run ` npm i `
- Run ` npm start ` to get the server up and rolling.


### Note for new express-generator projects
If you are looking to replicate this project on your local, `express-generator` can be used by:

- Running `npm i express-generator -g` - you may need `sudo` if you need to setup global npm dependencies 
- For newer node versions, simply run `npx express-generator <name-of-your-project>`
